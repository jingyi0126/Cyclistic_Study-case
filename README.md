# Riding Through Time: Analyzing Bike-Sharing Trends

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike-sharing data from April to September 2020, focusing on understanding user behavior, ride patterns, and preferences. By examining differences between casual and member users, identifying peak usage times, and exploring the types of bikes preferred, this analysis aims to provide valuable insights for optimizing bike-sharing services.

## Methodology

The analysis employs various data visualization techniques using R to interpret the bike-sharing data. Key aspects explored include user type distribution, ride duration, peak usage times, and bike type preferences.

## Data

The data used in this project consists of bike-sharing records from April to September 2020. Each dataset contains detailed information on individual bike rides, including start and end times, station names, ride duration, user types, and bike types.
